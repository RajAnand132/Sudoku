# Sudoku
# Terminalogy
A Sudoku (i.e. the puzzle) is a partially completed grid. A grid has 9 rows, 9 columns and 9 boxes (or blocks or regions), each having 9 cells (or squares), for a total of 81 cells. The initially defined values are clues or givens. An ordinary Sudoku (i.e. a proper Sudoku) has one solution. Rows, columns and regions can be collectively referred to as groups, of which the grid has 27. The One Rule can be compactly stated as: "Each digit appears once in each group."

Mathematically, Sudoku is a NP-complete problem. Developed using back tracking concept of data structures.
